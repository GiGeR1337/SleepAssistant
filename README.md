## How It Works
1. Users register and log in.
2. Users can create sleep logs by entering bedtime, wake time, sleep quality, and habits (like caffeine and screen usage).
3. Users can view, edit, and delete their own sleep records.
4. On the homepage, users can see their latest 5 sleep entries in a table.
5. If the user wants personalized advice, they can press the "Get Advice" button. Gemini AI will analyze their recent sleep data and return a short tip.
6. This advice is saved and shown until the user generates new advice.
7. Admins can access a special panel to view all users and remove inappropriate or test accounts if needed.

Note: Advice will not be generated unless at least one sleep record exists.
